                </div>
                <p>
                    The Howling Castle is a film rich in meaning and interpretation, that's why we will see only one here. First of all, The Moving Castle is a film created by the studio Ghibli and more precisely by Hayao Miyazaki. It was released in 2004 just after The Cat Kingdom in 2002.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The film is about Sophie, a young woman who makes hats and one day meets Hauru, a man who lives in a howling castle. She meets the witch of the land, who, jealous of her youth and beauty, steals her beauty, making Sophie old and ugly, in some way she decides to leave her town because she is unrecognizable.
                </p>
                <p>
                    She will reach Hauru's howling castle and become a full-time maid. At the end of the film, she will save Hauru who will lose his heart, his humanity, because of the war.

                    <h3>The role of Sophie</h3>
                </div>
                <p>
                    Sophie is the main character of the film, she is the protagonist that we will follow throughout the script. Sophie is a young girl working as a hat maker, this is not insignificant, indeed Sophie is ugly and to consolidate this point the author has made sure that she works in a store where appearance is more than important.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So important that when she meets the witch of the land, the witch will cast a spell on her that will highlight from an external point of view how Sophie really sees herself, old and ugly.
                    This will be confirmed by the moments when we see Sophie become young again without any apparent reason, in truth Sophie becomes beautiful and young again when she feels happy and well in her body, while when she is sad or unhappy her old age will be accentuated.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At the end of the film, in love with Hauru, she succeeds in finding the door to his heart, allowing her to find the good in him and bring him back to life.

                    <h3>The importance of Hauru</h3>
                </div>
                <p>
                    Hauru is the second main character of the film, he is a man who goes from lady to lady, as the people living in the city call him. He lives in the howling castle which is a representation of the shell of his heart, a flame called calcifer empowers the entire structure which is in constant motion.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The howling castle comes and goes as a man who goes from lady to lady would and that is why towards the end of the film it is destroyed, because Hauru is definitely in love with Sophie and wants only her in his life.
                </p>
                <p>
                    War is a subject that surrounds Hauru, he is often asked by different countries to take part in the war. This will transform him more and more until he keeps a monstrous form that only Sophie could cancel. The war will end as it began, with a snap of the fingers, by the decision of a prince who was touched by Sophie's love for Hauru.

                    <h3>The witch of the lands</h3>
                </div>
                <p>
                    The witch of the land is a woman greedy of beauty and love. This is why she will cast the spell on Sophie, because she is jealous of her youth and her love for Hauru. She will look for love throughout the movie but will never find it. The climax of this search for love is during the scene of the staircase towards the middle of the film, the witch will have difficulty to climb the staircase and loses its youth while Sophie with the old appearance will succeed without difficulty to climb it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At the end of the film she tries to find love again by trying to steal Hauru's heart. However, she will retract, leaving Hauru's heart to Sophie to let them accomplish the love she has been looking for.

                    <h3>A changing vision</h3>
                </div>
                <p>
                    The film will have a radical change between the beginning and the end of the film. At the beginning, Sophie finds herself ugly, Hauru does not find himself and the witch of the land is looking for love. At the end, we find the inverse situations. Sophie will finally accept herself, Hauru will finally find who he is and what he loves, and the witch of the land will give up her search for love to give space to the love of others.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The vision of love is in perpetual motion in the film, with free and volatile love transforming into concrete and solid love. Hayao Miyazaki makes us understand through his representation of love, that it can take many forms and can be more or less complex.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The vision of the human being is then changing and adapts to what he knows and what he wants to know, here the change exists only when we seek to find it. Without research the change of thought is not, and so, does not exist.
