                    <h3>From sanctuary to monument</h3>
                </div>
                <p>
                    The White Castle is a monument in Thailand, it is well known by people for his particular style and his absence of color. His pure white has a meaning, it refers to the ideal of purity that buddhists follow throughout their lives. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    To see the castle you have to step onto a bridge which crosses a sea of arms, this sea is a representation of damnation. Despite their desire to grab the bridge to be free and live a decent afterlife, they can’t, because they had sins in their life.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All the monument is an Ode to buddhism, with references everywhere, but that doesn’t mean that it’s religious. For history point the White castle is builded from a restoration of an ancient buddhist monument named, Wat Rong Khun.

                    <h3>A castle that almost didn’t see the light of day</h3>
                </div>
                <p>
                    The renovations of the castle started in 1997, at the beginning only one person wanted to take charge of the renovations costs, Chalermchai Kositpipat. The thought behind this action is not an act of pure kindness, the man actually wanted to offer the renovated temple to Buddha in order to attain full immortality. The amount that was used at the time was estimated at 30.24 million euros, an exorbitant sum.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Unfortunately in 2014 an earthquake raged over the Chiang Rai region, the area where the temple is located. After that, the architect Kositpipat wanted to destroy the temple, even if it meant that the money invested would be lost forever, he was afraid that it would collapse and then that the inhabitants would be threatened. The temple was finally not destroyed but rehabilitated a second time, it is this temple that we still know nowaday.

                    <p>
                        This is the most important building of the White Castle, inside we find the legendary whiteness of the castle with pieces of reflective glass embedded in the plaster. Unlike what we would think, the temple does not only have murals representing Buddha. Instead we have representations of good and evil in our society with pop culture icons like Batman, Superman, Terminator or alien spaceships.

                    <p>
                        This is where the travelers arrived after they crossed the bridge. They are greeted by two huge statues acting as guards at the stairs leading to the Ubosot building. We can also see several statues of Buddha meditating in front of the doors of the Ubosot.

                    <p>
                        As its name indicates, this is where the dead were cremated at the time. This place was used by the Buddhists to make it easier for their soul to detach from their body to be reborn again. With this process they could also give back to earth what it had given them, a body.

                    <p>
                        The building is the one of toilet. The gold of the building represents the body in contrast to the white of the other buildings which represents the purity of the spirit. The main idea of this building is to show the futility that men have to focus on material and useless possessions, and this explains the excessive and unnecessary use of gold for a building used only as a toilet.

                    <h3>Art and religious</h3>
                </div>
                <p>
                    In conclusion the Wat Rong Khun is a religious monument but not only. If we take the essence of the building, what it was originally and what it was built for, we can say that it is a religious building related to the Buddhist religion, only we cannot stop there! The building has undergone several renovations and this has served to renovate its image but also to change it. Today the Wat Rong Khun receives works of art such as sculptures from pop culture, which could be compared to a museum that stores pieces of art. The renovation has also allowed an architectural jewel that once contemplated by its visitors it is said that it’s unforgettable by the eye.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In fact we can say that the change that man has brought to it has allowed to put value to something that did not have any. The change was made naturally, certainly with difficulty and problems, but naturally, there was no need to force the thing and this is what makes the work even more enjoyable. So yes it’s the man who brought the change and who decided at the time to carry out this change, but that does not mean that it’s not natural, it’s quite natural to want to renovate or renew something you care about, it‘s not up to others to decide whether or not the change should be made, it’s only up to the person concerned to say whether or not he wants to make the change.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All of this to say that the Wat Rong Khun is religious by its past and its essence but that it’s also a piece of art that today thousands of visitors have the pleasure to visit.
