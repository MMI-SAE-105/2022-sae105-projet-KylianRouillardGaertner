                    <h3>Happier than Ever</h3>
                </div>
                <p>
                    The music begins in a calm atmosphere in which Billie questions the reasons for her last breakup. She talks about a toxic relationship but in a quiet way, as if it were insignificant to her.                </p>
                <p>
                    During the whole first part of the clip the room fills up little by little with water, it’s a symbol of her toxic relationship that came little by little in her life without Billie being able to notice it. The climax of this water intrusion is when Billie seems to be done with what she has to say. She walks up to a door and opens it, this is when the water completely overwhelms her and that she starts struggling to get out of this situation. The music also begins a change to become more electric and more rock.                </p>

                    <h3>The délivrance</h3>
                </div>
                <p>
                    When Billie is submerged in water we have a metaphor with Billie not being able to handle the toxic situation because it is too late. The music that changes to a more rock style as well as the omnipresent rain in the clip are also there to accentuate the overwhelming situation of Billie.                </p>
                <p>
                    The rock style also allows Billie to let it go and say what is really on her mind. This scene allows the artist to really say what she has in mind, she couldn't take it anymore, it was necessary that her emotions come out. During her verses we understand that for her the relationship had nothing good, the man with whom she lived was a bad person and she never wants to see him again.                </p>
                <p>
                    An important sentence in this part of the song is: “You made me hate this city” clearly here the man was so abusive that Billie didn't even want to have anything to do with the city they were in, that was reminding her too much of her ex companion.
                <p>
                    The final point of this verse is at the moment of Billie's scream, this scream is a scream of deliverance allowing her to let go of the last emotions she had left for him.                
                </p>

                <div class="titrearticle">
                    <h3>A change of libération</h3>
                </div>
                <p>
                    So we can say that Billie puts an end with this song to her last relationship. She made it seem like she had moved on, only she hadn't and she needed this music to allow herself to evolve, to change. If we look at the works of Billie Eilish we can notice a certain evolution from each song, after an album it allowed her to evolve.                </p>
                <p>
                    Here with this music the change is even more obvious because it is in the core of the music. The radical change that was made in the middle of the music is useful to separate the two parts of the music certainly, but also for Billie itself, it allows her to dissociate what she experienced and how she saw the situation at the time, and then the after situation, where she was overwhelmed by the whole situation with a heart turned upside down by the waves of disaster that fell on her.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here the change has been more than beneficial, changing life to have a new look on life is a difficult choice but sometimes necessary. We never know if we should do it or not because by doing it we say goodbye to a whole part of our life. That's what Billie did with saying goodbye to quiet music and embracing more rock music. This will allow her in the future to really state what is on her mind.                </p>
                <p>
                    The vision of humans is in consequence changeable and adaptable at what he knows and what he wants to know, here the change exists only when we seek to find him. Without research the change of thought is not, and therefore, does not exist.                </p>
