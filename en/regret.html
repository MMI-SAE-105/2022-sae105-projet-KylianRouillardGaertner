                    <h3>The abuses of social networks</h3>
                </div>
                <p>
                    Today, man has made computers an extension of himself. This extension can be noticed with the omnipresence of the cell phone, no matter where we go, we need it and keep it close to us. With it also comes the use of media, and more specifically social networks. The problem with social networks at the moment is our relationship with them. The networks themselves are not a problem but the way we use them is.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Most users using a social network post pictures of themselves or their daily life, only with time the networks have become the reflection that we give to others. A race was launched to the one who would have the most beautiful life, the most perfect life. With time it became common, so common that we no longer care about what the other person in front of us thinks, but we care about what the other person behind the screen will think.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Life has become a story of superficiality common to almost everyone, so we end up with profiles that are all similar, all perfect.

                    <h3>Result of a generation</h3>
                </div>
                <p>
                    As a result of the superficiality that we give too much to social networks, we find ourselves looking for originality in others. If all the profiles on the internet look the same and are no longer distinguishable then what do we really know about our interlocutors?
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition to this problem we have another one, some people, even if they know about it, can't distinguish the parallel with reality. This results in waves of intense depression and severe dysphoria for some. Noticing so many perfect people they feel inferior and not worthy, a real problem when we know that anxiety and social disorders can favorably increase in young people when they use social networks.

                    <h3>The hope in regret</h3>
                </div>
                <p>
                    We can still have hope for future generations that will surely not have this problem. We can already see improvements with the diversity of accounts currently available on social networks. More and more people dare to show themselves in the true light, no matter their body shape, their face, their flaws.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One person I think about is Yseult, a singer who released in 2019 a music called Corps. In this music she shows herself naked singing lyrics about the difficulties she had to accept herself as she is. Following her music she will post images of her on social networks, which I find a remarkable act and that few people would have had the courage to do. The word is getting out more and more and the acceptance of others is more and more common on the internet.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I would like to transform my regret of generation into a message of hope for the future generations. It is true that we were not lucky in this case, but thanks to this we can prevent future generations from having to suffer this.
