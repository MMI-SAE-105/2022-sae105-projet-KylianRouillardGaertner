                    <h3>Description of a special character</h3>
                </div>
                <p>
                    The main character of the show is Richard, third son of the York family. He is described as deformed and is therefore removed from the English court, which will increase his rage and desire for revenge. His ultimate goal is the throne and he is ready to do anything to get it, even the insipid murder of his elder brothers by accusing others.
                </p>
                <p>
                    He will first kill Edward who is king of England after a war between the Yorks, the white rose family, and the Lancasters, the red rose family. He will not kill his brother directly, to achieve his goals he will form a plot to set his brothers against each other, to create discord in order to better manipulate and murder. Once his brothers are killed and all obstacles to the throne are removed, he will become king and be named Richard III.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once king, he will kill his wife to consolidate his power over the kingdom. By dint of murder Richard is haunted by his demons and will have halucinations, and this just before a decisive battle for him. During the battle, Richard's horse falls under him and he exclaims with his famous line: "A horse! A horse! My kingdom for a horse!" This sentence means that at this precise moment he could have given his kingdom just for a horse, probably because he knew that it was his last moments before his death.

                    <h3>A deadly change</h3>
                </div>
                <p>
                    So here we have Richard who wants to make a radical change in his life, to no longer be seen as the hunchback but as the king. It's a change that may seem acceptable, but when we see the ways in which it's done, we may have doubts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So why has the change not been beneficial here? It's actually quite simple, the change was forced and not brought about or chosen at some point. Richard wanted too much change at once, and it worked for a while, but very soon afterwards, another change took place, which led to his death. Change does not come alone.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A complete and radical change is often accompanied by other changes that are not predictable and desired. In this case, the problem was not the change, but the lack of reflection on the part of Richard who did not think about all that it could cause.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The change is therefore forced here, which leads to additional changes, both positive and negative. We cannot force destiny to change without receiving the counterpart, the change is here uncertain and unhealthy. Change is therefore not necessarily positive for some people.
