                    <h3>An Unexpected Action</h3>
                </div>
                <p>
                    Our generation is a generation that has done a lot of act and fought for climate protection. We even have Greta Thunberg who is a world famous environmental activist from our generation. So my hope is, as you can guess, ecological.                </p>
                <p>
                    Our generation has done so much to make an impact on climate inaction that it seems obvious to me to talk about ecology. The hope here is the one of action, certainly there were actions to denounce and make some people react but there is still no concrete action to counteract the massive pollution and the overproduction for example.                </p>
                <p>
                    If there is no response to our actions then for what did we have done this? We are not sure for a future but we are moving forward every day. Why should we continue if the end is already decided? What comes next is scary, we can't know the future at 100% and what our actions will really bring in this world. However we continue to move forward and this, because we do not lose hope to see our demands and for some our dreams come true.                </p>

                    <h3>Hope, the engine of a generation</h3>
                </div>
                <p>
                    So we keep hope and this is what makes us continue to exist and what makes us to want to move forward. What I want to transmit through this article is not the fact that it is necessary to act for the ecology, at least it is not the first goal.                </p>
                <p>
                    My goal with this article is to question you. Why do you move forward in life? What drives you to continue doing what you do every day? Most of the time it's a personal and intimate reason that you can't disclose to anyone. For many people, the simple fact of hoping is enough to keep them going, even in the most complicated situations of their lives. I am not even talking about religious hope, I am talking about hope in general and in all its forms.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We hope first of all because we are not sure and it’s that thing that will strengthen our hope, the more uncertain we are the more we want to believe.
                </p>
                <p style="text-align: center;">
                    Hope does not make us live, hope allows us to believe when we are incapable of it.
